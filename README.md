# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To develop the Onspot Ticket Reservation System in Railway Station using Star UML tool.

# Problem Statement: Railway Management System

The current manual and semi-automated processes for managing railway passenger ticketing and travel are inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Passengers face difficulties in booking tickets, 
checking train availability, verifying seat status, and tracking journey updates. Additionally, railway staff struggle with managing reservations, cancellations, seat allotments, and handling large volumes of 
passenger data.

There is a need for an integrated Railway Management System that automates and streamlines the entire passenger journeyâ€”from ticket booking and seat allocation to boarding and travel tracking. The system should 
support online and offline ticket reservations, real-time train status updates, passenger information management, and generate travel reports for both passengers and authorities.
